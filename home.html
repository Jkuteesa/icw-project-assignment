    <p>WHAT do we mean by quality education?</p>
    <img src="practicalimg2.jpeg" alt="Description of image" style="float: left;">
    <p>According to this goal, a quality education is one that focuses on the whole childâ€” the social, emotional, mental, physical, and cognitive development of each student regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or geographic location. Based on the pillars of providing excellent teaching; utilizing and providing access to developmentally appropriate and effective learning tools; and establishing supportive learning environments, a quality education provides the outcomes needed for individuals, communities, and societies to prosper.</p>
    <P>No intervention has the impact on a child, family, community and society like education. And yet amid tremendous growth in enrolment rates, the region lacks trained teachers, adequate supplies, and hence the chance for all children to enjoy a quality education.</P>
